# Caesar - CS50

### Description

As part of CS50 the task was set to implement a program that encrypts messages
using Caesar's cipher:

*$ ./caesar 13
plaintext:  HELLO
ciphertext: URYYB*

Upon usage you would select your *KEY* number which would determine the key for your secret message as follows:


plaintext
      HELLO
+ key	1111				
= ciphertext	I	F	M	M	P

### How to use

$ ./caesar 13
plaintext:  hello, world
ciphertext: uryyb, jbeyq

### Technologies
- C Programming
